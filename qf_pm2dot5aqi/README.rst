qf_pm2dot5aqi Application
=========================

Purpose
-------

With the fires raging in California, air quality is a concern. So I
thought that it would be fun to create a small app using QuickFeather to
monitor the local air quality. This document captures the steps that I
went through to create a device that monitors the PM2.5 level, and uses
the LED to indicate whether the level is considered, Good, Moderate or
Unhealthy.

Sensor connections
------------------

Adafruit has a nifty PM2.5 sensor: |qf_pm2dot5aqi PMS5003|

The datasheet lets us know the device uses a UART interface with pinout:
|qf_pm2dot5aqi PMS5003-pinout|

While the datasheet indicates that we can leave SET and RESET
unconnected, to get maximum flexibility we will connect them to GPIO so
that we can control them.

QuickFeather connections
------------------------

Grabbing the QuickFeather User Guide we take a look at the board I/O
diagram: |qf_pm2dot5aqi qf-board|

GND
~~~

How to connect the GND is obvious (use J3.1, or J3.13, or J8.16).

VCC
~~~

The datasheet specifies that VCC must be 5V, not 3.3V – so how are we
going to get that? Since the board is powered by USB, and the normal USB
voltage is 5V, perhaps VBAT (J2.1) is 5V? We can look at the schematic
to find out. Zooming in on J2 we find that J2.1 is connected to VBAT:
|qf_pm2dot5aqi qf-schematic-J2|

And VBAT is driven by the charger:

|qf_pm2dot5aqi qf-schematic-VBAT|

So, it is unlikely to be 5V, more likely to be 4.2V. A quick measurement
shows it to be 4.3V on my QuickFeather. We’ll just have to see if that
is good enough, otherwise we have the tricky task of finding VBUS on the
board as soldering a wire to it.

SET
~~~

We want to connect this to a GPIO so that it is under software control.
However, a search of the User Guide results in no matches. So, that
means we need to go to the S3 documentation. We could go to the
datasheet, but the S3 TRM (Technical Reference Manual) has a lot more
information, so let’s use that. |qf_pm2dot5aqi s3-TRM|

| Where we learn that GPIO[0] shares IO_6 (pad 6) with several other
  signals.
| The table in pincfg.c is used to control which function drives the IO.
| Continuing the search, we can build the following table: \|GPIO \| IO
  \| IO \| \| :---: \| :---: \| :---: \| \| 0 \| 6 \| 24 \| \| 1 \| 9 \|
  26 \| \|2 \|11 \|28\| \|3 \|14 \|30\| \|4 \|18 \|31\| \|5 \|21 \|36\|
  \|6 \|22 \|38\| \|7 \|23 \|45\|

Notice that each GPIO can drive two different pins. The table in
pincfg.c is used to select which of the two IOs is driven by the GPIO.
Now we need to understand which pins on the QuickFeather are driven by
the GPIO and if there is and conflicting function. The QuickFeather User
Guide has a useful table that helps with this:

|qf_pm2dot5aqi qf-ug-iotable|

From this we can see that GPIO0 can drive IO_6, which is connected to
the User Button and J8.10. GPIO1 can drive IO_9, but the table is silent
about IO_9 which presumably means that it has some other use. Filling
out the complete table we get: \|GPIO \|IO \|Function \|Connector \|IO
\|Function \|Connector \| \| :---: \| :---: \| --- \| :---: \| :---: \|
--- \| :---: \| \|0 \|6 \|User Button \|J8.10 \|24 \|I2S Slave DATA
\|J8.4 \| \|1 \|9 \| \| \|26 \| \| \| \|2 \|11 \|IO \|J8.6 \|28 \|PDM
Data \|J8.1 \| \|3 \|14 \|SWD CLK \|J6.4 \|30 \|IO \|J3.10 \| \|4 \|18
\|Blue LED \|N/A \|31 \|I2S Slave CLK \|J8.5 \| \|5 \|21 \|Green LED
\|N/A \|36 \|SPIM MISO \|J3.4 \| \|6 \|22 \|Red LED \|N/A \|38 \|SPIM
MOSI \|J3.5 \| \|7 \|23 \|I2S Slave WCLK \|J8.3 \|45 \|UART RX \|J3.3 \|

We need GPIO4,5 and 6 to control the LED to indicate air quality, so
those are not appropriate.

GPIO2 is shorted to PDM data so that is not available without modifying
the board.

GPIO1 does not go to a connector.

That leaves GPIO0/IO_24 for the SET and GPIO7/IO_23 for the RESET.

So now we can create our wiring table: \|PMS5003 Pin|PMS5003 Function
\|QuickFeather Connector \|QuickFeather Function\| \| :---: \| :---: \|
:---: \| --- \| \|1 \|VCC \|J2.1 \|VBAT \| \|2 \|GND \|J3.13 \|GND \|
\|3 \|SET \|J8.4 \|GPIO0 \| \|4 \|RX \|J3.2 \|TX \* \| \|5 \|TX \|J3.3
\|RX \| \|6 \|RESET \|J8.3 \|GPIO7 \|

| • Note that you must be careful with RX and TX. Does RX mean that this
  pin receives, or that it expects to drive a receiver?
| In other words, do you connect RX to RX, or RX to TX.

Creating the program
--------------------

Since this is a purely software app, a good starting point is
qf_helloworldsw. So, we copy that directory into a new directory called
qf_pm2dot5aqi.

Add
~~~

-  pm2dot5monitortask.c

Modify
~~~~~~

If you want to see exactly what was changed and added in the code,
compare this project to qf_helloworldsw. The changed files are:

-  Main.c
-  Main_dbg_cli_menu.c
-  Copy and modify qf_hardwaresetup.c
-  Pincfg_table.c
-  Fw_global_config.h

Computing AQI
-------------

https://cfpub.epa.gov/airnow/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi

|qf_pm2dot5aqi aqi-def|

|qf_pm2dot5aqi aqi-normalize|

| Since these are normalized values, with 100 set as the acceptable
  limit, we need to know the mapping.
| For the US the curve is defined by the EPA and can be found at
  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjtzK3YpJrsAhUMvJ4KHaBfD8wQFjALegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airnow.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2018-05%2Faqi-technical-assistance-document-may2016.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1_iX6rgxZBBNPTdzqIn_D3

The first part of the table is: |qf_pm2dot5aqi aqi-table|

| This is a piece-wise linear table, such that values from the range
  0-12 are mapped onto the range 0-50, and those from the range 12 to
  35.4 are mapped onto 50 to 100. The condensed table is: \|PM2.5 ug/m^3
  \|AQI \|Meaning (if less than AQI) \|AQI Color \|LED Color \| \| :---:
  \| :---: \| --- \| :---: \| :---: \| \|0 \|0 \| \| \| \|
| \|12 \|50 \|Good \|Green \|Green \| \|35.4 \|100 \|Moderate \|Yellow
  \|Blue \| \|55.4 \|150 \|Unhealthy for sensitive groups \|Orange \|Red
  \| \|150.4 \|200 \|Unhealthy \|Red \|Purple \| \|250.4 \|300 \|Very
  Unhealthy \|Purple \|Purple \| \|500.4 \|500 \|Hazardous \|Brown
  \|Purple \|

Finished product
----------------

Showing green, so my indoor AQI is Good. When I take it outside, the
color switches to blue indicating Moderate air quality. So now I know
that the natural filtering effect of the house, combined with a number
of HEPA filters really helps.
